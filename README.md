# Fault tolerant routing multiplexer for NV-FPGAS

Exploration and simulation of routing multiplexer architectures for FPGAs with non-volatile (NV) configuration memory.

This work is based on my master thesis at [TU Darmstadt Institute of Computer Systems](https://www.rs.tu-darmstadt.de/). Until its submission there is going to be a lot of WIP in here.
